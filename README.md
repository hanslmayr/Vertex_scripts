To reproduce the figures I showed last time, you should run through the following steps:

1.	Download and Replace the folder ‘ratSomatosensoryCortex’ in your Vertex toolbox folder.
2.	Open QuadrPulse.m, edit the intensity parameter (i.e. mA) to yield different intensity levels. I played around with values between 1 and 80 mA and good reasonable results.
3.	Run the script for a few different intensity parameters. This will save the data in different folders 
4.	Run Comp_Stim_Intens.m to look at the results.
